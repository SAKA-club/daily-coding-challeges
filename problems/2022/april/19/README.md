# Arrays and String 1.5
#### April 19, 2022

**One Away**: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, 
or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) awav.

```
OneAway("taco", "cat") // should return true
OneAway("blue", "green") // should return false
OneAway("Funk", "PunK") // should return fasle
```
